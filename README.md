# EZChat for PeerTube
A Twitch-like chat plugin for PeerTube livestreams.

This is a very early release and only has barebone functionallity.

My goal with this project was to create a frictionless, viewer focused, chat feature for PeerTube that allows everyone to get into the chat as fast as possible withput any sign-ups or other annoying things. Authenticate EZ and get into the chat!

## Features
- Chat like you would in Twitch chat.
- Local users are automatically logged in to chat.
- Remote users can authenticate to chat with any Fediverse account by using an OTP DM method.
- Custon display name and colors.

## Todo
- Add moderation capabilities. Timeout or Ban.
- Allow Twitch accounts to authenticate with OAuth.
- Add custom emotes.

## Contribute
Feel free to fix my horrible JavaScript code. This is my first JS project and it is a mess. But a working mess.
